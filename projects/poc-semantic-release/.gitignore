# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work,
#   so we ignore it for safety.

# poetry
poetry.lock
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, poetry may install dependencies that don't work,
#   so we ignore it for safety.
#   See https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#lock for more details.
poetry.lock
#   Uncomment the following line if you would like to ignore the virtual environment created
#   by Poetry (if configured so in poetry config).
# .venv/
#   See https://python-poetry.org/docs/configuration/#virtualenvs-in-project for more details.
# PEP 582; used by e.g. github.com/David-OConnor/pyflow
